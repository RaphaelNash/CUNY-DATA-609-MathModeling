# P228 # 1 

Consider a model for the long-term dining behavior of the students at College USA. It is found that 25% of the students who eat at the college's Grease Dining Hall return to eat there again, whereas those who eat at Sweet Dining Hall have a 93% return rate. These are the only two dining halls available on campus, and assume that all students eat at one of these halls. Formulate a model to solve for the long-term percentage of students eating at each hall.


|       | Grease | Sweet |
|------:|-------:|------:|
|Grease | 0.25   | 0.75  |
|Sweet  | 0.07   | 0.93  |

   
$S_n =$ Percent of diners at Sweet Dining Hall for a meal period

$G_n =$ Percent of diners at Greese Dining Hall for a meal period

$G_{n+1} = .25 G_n + .07 S_n$

$S_{n+1} = .75 G_n + .93 G_n$



```{r}


grease_n <- function ( g, s) {
   .25*g + .07 * s 
}


sweet_n <- function ( g, s) {
   .75*g + .93 * s 
}

g<- 1
s<-0 
n<-0
 
dining <- data.frame(
  n = n,
  g = g,
  s = s ) 
  
  
 
  
for (n in 1:20 ) {
  g <- grease_n( g,s )
  s <- sweet_n( g,s )
  n <- n 
    
dining <- rbind ( dining , data.frame(
                                    n = n,

                                    s = s )
                       )

# P 232 #1

Consider a stereo with CD player, FM/AM radio tuner, speakers (dual), and power ampli er (PA) components, as displayed with the reliabilities shown in Figure 6.11. Determine the system's reliability. What assumptions are required in your model?


![](p3.png)


Assumptions:

  1) Faluire of Each Component is Independant
  2) We Have 3 SubSystems:
  + PA
  + Speakers
  + System Components (CD/Radio)
  
  
$R_{total} = R_{pa} * R_{speakers}*R_{comp}$

$R_{pa} = .95$

$R_{speakers} = (.99 + .99) - (.99)(.99)$

$R_{comp} = (.98 + .97) - (.98)(.97)$

$R_{total} = (.95)((.99 + .99) - (.99)(.99))   ( (.98 + .97) - (.98)(.97))$

$R_{total} =  .95 * .9999 *   .9994$

$R_{total} = .949$

For Table 2.7, predict weight as a function of height.


```{r}

hw_df <- data.frame (
  h =  c( 60, 61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80),
  w =  c(132,136,141,145,150,155,160,165,170,175,180,185,190,195,201,206,212,218,223,229,234)
  
)

n <- NROW(hw_df)

m <- ( (n * sum(hw_df [,"h"]* hw_df [,"w"]  )  ) -(sum(hw_df [,"h"]) ) * sum(hw_df [,"w"]) ) / ( n* sum(hw_df [,"h"]^2) -  (sum(hw_df [,"h"])) ^2   )   
 
b <- (sum(hw_df [,"w"]) - (m * sum(hw_df [,"h"]) ))/n

#sse

 

sse  <-  sum((hw_df$w - (m * hw_df$h + b))^2)
sst <- sum((hw_df$w  - mean(hw_df$w ))^2)

ssr <- sst-sse
r_sq <- 1-(sse/sst)
```

Equation: weight = `r round(m,2) ` height + ( `r round(b,2)`)

SSE: `r round(sse,2)  `

SSR: `r round(sse,2) `

$R^2$: `r round( r_sq,4)  `
