#p 307 #1 

Consider the graph in Figure 8.11

![](1.png)

a) Write down the set of edges:
E(g)= {ab; ae; af; bc; bd; cd; de; df; ef}


b) wich edges are incident with vertex b

ab,bc,bd

c) Which verticies are adjacent to vertex c
{a,h}

d) compute deg(a)
3

e) compute |E(G)| ={ab; ae; af; bc; bd; cd; de; df; ef }  =9



#p320 #10

Positions players can play:

Alice|Bonie|Courtney|Deb|Ellen|Fay|Gladys|Hermione
-----|-----|--------|------|-----|---|------|---------
1,2  | 1   | 1,2    |3,4,5 | 2   | 1 |3,4   |2,3


![](8-7.png)

What changes if the coad decides she can't play Hermione in position?

There is a whole in the graph. Only Deb can play position 5.  Gladys can play position 3 or 4 but with out hermione there is a whole at position 3.   

#p330 #1

Find a shortest path from node a to node j in the graph in Figure 8.33 with edge weights shown on the graph.

ShortPth <- get.shortest.paths(g2, "a", "j")    # List of path 8->2

E(g2)$color <- "SkyBlue2"
E(g2)$width <- 1
E(g2, path=ShortPth$vpath[[1]])$color <- "red"
E(g2, path=unlist(ShortPth$vpath))$color <- "red"
E(g2, path=unlist(ShortPth[[1]]))$color <- "red"
plot(g2)


```

Shortest Path from a --> j is `{r}  sp_lenght `
